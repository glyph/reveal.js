          <h1>Content First</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            In this talk I’m going to discuss presentation style and rhetorical
            gimmickery a lot, because those are features that are common to all
            talks, technical or not.  I’m not going to talk a lot about
            tehcnical content, because that’s unique to your particular talk.
            However, your technical content is the important bit.  Don’t get
            wrapped up in any of the advice that I’m giving and think of it as
            gospel, because if your technical content is not good, your
            technical audience <em>will</em> notice that.
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h1>No Pressure</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            All that stuff about technical content is usually true, of course,
            except for in <em>this</em> talk; since I’m ostensibly giving a
            talk about how to be entertaining and compelling while giving a
            talk, if I’m not entertaining and compelling then I’m going to be
            missing the whole point.  However, again, I stress that this is not
            true of the average technical talk: if you focus on the content
            first and make sure you have something meaningful to say, your
            presentation doesn’t have to be perfect.
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h1>But...</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            The fact that an <em>imperfect</em> presentation is OK does not
            mean that a <em>crappy</em> presentation is OK.  So I’m going to
            talk a lot about what makes the average presentation crappy, and
            steps that you can take to avoid those common pitfalls. If
            you <em>do</em> successfully avoid these common pitfalls, you'll be
            way ahead of the game.  A lot of presentational style is mindlessly
            copy/pasted from the speaker's previous experience watching people
            speak, so antipatterns propagate throughout a majority of technical
            talks.  Once you really start paying attention to what works and
            doesn't work, you can craft a much more engaging than average - at
            least the "talk at a meetup or conference" average - without all
            that much effort.

          <h2>Step 0:</h2>
          <h1 class="fragment"><i>Relax</i></h1>
          <h2 class="fragment">(Rehearse)</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            The most important thing that you need to do when giving a any kind
            of talk is (click) to be relaxed.  You should test your laptop with
            a bunch of different projectors so you're not worried about it
            breaking.  You should show up with a backup copy of your slides on
            a USB key in case your laptop doesn't work at all.  I'm going to be
            a bit heretical here - most people who give public-speaking advice
            will tell you that rehearsing (click) is super super important so
            you can deliver your talk well - and say that if you know a
            technical topic well, you can probably wing it.  Rehearsing is more
            a means to an end, and the end is making sure that when you take
            the stage, you are composed and sure of yourself.  Being nervous
            while giving a talk is a negative feedback loop: you're nervous, so
            you make mistakes, so you get more nervous, so you make more
            mistakes.

          <h1>Step 1:</h1>
          <h1 class="fragment">Introduce Yourself</h1>
          <h1 class="fragment">Credential Yourself</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            The first thing you should do when you're delivering a technical
            talk is, briefly, (click) introduce yourself, and as part of doing
            so (click) establish why you should be talking about the subject
            you’re talking about.  There’s a reluctance in technical circles to
            describe your qualifications in terms of academic degrees, job
            titles, or high-profile project experience, because that sounds
            like an argument from authority, which we all know, is a fallacy,
            and we all want our ideas to stand on their own merits.  However,
            if you don’t give some indication of your credentials, then your
            audience will be distracted towards the beginning of your talk as
            they try to put your words into context.  It’s fine if
            you <em>don’t</em> have any specific credentials on the topic that
            you’re discussing too - by laying that out right at the beginning,
            you’re letting the more experienced members of the audience know
            that it’s OK to give you feedback at the end.

            When it comes to writing technical talks, I’m lazy.  (For the designers in the audience, the irony of that infographic is that I had to vertically center a &lt;div&gt; to get it to work...)

            we <em>have</em> to be lazy - by which I mean economical about the
            effort we invest - with my talks.  For pretty much all of us,
            technical presenting is at best an extracurricular activity, and at
            worst something we have to do entirely outside of work.  Luckily,
            creating a technical presentation that is miles ahead of the pack
            is really not all that hard, as long as you keep a few simple
            principles in mind.

            When you're discussing a piece of code, even one you've
            aggressively trimmed to fit on a slide, you will generally need to
            move from one portion of it to another.  It's important that your
            audience be able to follow which piece exactly you're talking
            about.  You can do this with a laser pointer, but (click) it's
            better if you embed this information into the slides.

          <h2>The Audience <br> Isn’t Looking <br> At Your Laptop</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            The important principle to remember about slides with code on them
            is that your audience isn't looking over your shoulder at your
            laptop screen.  They're looking at a blurry projector 25 feet
            across the room.

          <h2>The Audience Doesn’t <br> Have Your Code <br> In An Editor</h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            Your audience also doesn't have your code open in an editor.
            They're not running it in a terminal.  They have to keep the entire
            state of the code in their brain.

            One trick that you can use to help keep this in mind is to close
            your eyes and try to imagine re-constructing your whole example
            from scratch.  Maybe even try typing it with your eyes closed.  If
            you - the person who is familiar enough with this material to write
            a talk about it - can't <em>easily</em> do this in your head, then
            how do you expect your audience, who is new to the material, to do
            it?  Also, as this diagram shows, you should use syntax
            highlighting in your presentation, as various syntax colors
            activate different regions in the brain.
