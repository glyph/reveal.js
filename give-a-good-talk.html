          <h1>Content First</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            In this talk I’m going to discuss presentation style and rhetorical
            gimmickery a lot, because those are features that are common to all
            talks, technical or not.  I’m not going to talk a lot about
            tehcnical content, because that’s unique to your particular talk.
            However, your technical content is the important bit.  Don’t get
            wrapped up in any of the advice that I’m giving and think of it as
            gospel, because if your technical content is not good, your
            technical audience <em>will</em> notice that.
          </aside>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h1>No Pressure</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            All that stuff about technical content is usually true, of course,
            except for in <em>this</em> talk; since I’m ostensibly giving a
            talk about how to be entertaining and compelling while giving a
            talk, if I’m not entertaining and compelling then I’m going to be
            missing the whole point.  However, again, I stress that this is not
            true of the average technical talk: if you focus on the content
            first and make sure you have something meaningful to say, your
            presentation doesn’t have to be perfect.

          <h1>But...</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            The fact that an <em>imperfect</em> presentation is OK does not
            mean that a <em>crappy</em> presentation is OK.  So I’m going to
            talk a lot about what makes the average presentation crappy, and
            steps that you can take to avoid those common pitfalls.

            If you <em>do</em> avoid these common pitfalls

          <h1>Step 1:</h1>
          <h1 class="fragment">Introduce Yourself</h1>
          <h1 class="fragment">Credential Yourself</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            The first thing you should do in any technical talk is, briefly,
            (click) introduce yourself, and as part of doing so (click)
            establish why you should be talking about the subject you’re
            talking about.  There’s a reluctance in technical circles to
            describe your qualifications in terms of academic degrees, job
            titles, or high-profile project experience, because that sounds
            like an argument from authority, which we all know, is a fallacy,
            and we all want our ideas to stand on their own merits.  However,
            if you don’t give some indication of your credentials, then your
            audience will be distracted towards the beginning of your talk as
            they try to put your words into context.  It’s fine if
            you <em>don’t</em> have any specific credentials on the topic that
            you’re discussing too - by laying that out right at the beginning,
            you’re letting the more experienced members of the audience know
            that it’s OK to give you feedback at the end.

            how <em>you</em> might write a good technical presentation. (click)
            When it comes to writing technical talks, I’m lazy.  (For the designers in the audience, the irony of that infographic is that I had to vertically center a &lt;div&gt; to get it to work...)

            By "lazy" though, I really mean:

          <h1>You’re Busy</h1>
          <h1>I’m Busy</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            I know you’re really busy.  I’m busy too.  So we <em>have</em> to
            be lazy - by which I mean economical about the effort we invest -
            with my talks.  For pretty much all of us, technical presenting is
            at best an extracurricular activity, and at worst something we have
            to do entirely outside of work.  Luckily, creating a technical
            presentation that is miles ahead of the pack is really not all that
            hard, as long as you keep a few simple principles in mind.

            really, really important that you not do this at any point in your

            In an attempt to get away from the visually boring style depicted
            on the previous slide, some presenters have started offering advice
            to do this, instead, and it’s almost as bad.
